# Roadmap

## Upcoming Features

### 1. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Implement granular access control based on user roles to enhance security and manage permissions within the system effectively.

### 2. EnergyMonitoring microsevices

Implement EnergyMonitoring microservice.

### 3. Additional Device Integrations

Expand support for more types of smart devices, including motion sensors, thermostats, and security systems, ensuring greater flexibility and functionality.

### 4. Enhanced Energy Metrics

Develop more detailed energy consumption analytics, allowing users to visualize usage patterns and identify opportunities for energy savings.

### 5. User Dashboard

Create an intuitive web-based dashboard where users can manage devices, view usage statistics, and configure automations easily and efficiently.

### 6. Real-Time Notifications

Implement real-time alerts and notifications for specific events, such as devices operating outside scheduled times or energy usage exceeding predefined thresholds.

### 7. Ocelot Gateway

Implement Ocelot Gateway for supporting the whole system's requisitions.

### 8. Performance Optimization

Improve the performance of the API Gateway and microservices to ensure faster response times and better scalability as the user base grows.

### 9. Deployment

Establish a streamlined and automated deployment process to ensure that updates and new features can be rolled out efficiently and reliably. This includes setting up continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, automated testing, and monitoring to maintain system stability and performance.

## Finished Tasks

### 1. UserService API

Completed the implementation of the User Service, which includes user registration, authentication, and profile management.

### 2. DeviceService API

Completed the implementation of the Device Service, which includes device registration, management, and status monitoring.

### 3. AutomationService API

Completed the implementation of the Automation Service, which includes routine, room and group registration. For scheduled actions.

## Future Goals

### 1. Mobile Application

Develop a mobile app for iOS and Android, enabling users to control and monitor the **OwnLightSystem** directly from their mobile devices.

### 2. Machine Learning Integration

Utilize machine learning techniques to optimize energy usage, predict device maintenance needs, and personalize automations based on user habits.

### 3. Internationalization

Add support for multiple languages, making the **OwnLightSystem** accessible to a global and diverse user base.

### 4. Voice Control Integration

Integrate with voice assistants like Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, allowing users to control devices through voice commands for added convenience.

### 5. Expansion to Other Home Automation Types

Beyond lighting control, expand the system to include automations for other home aspects such as curtain control, entertainment systems, and household appliances.

### 6. Enhanced Security Measures

Strengthen security features, including multi-factor authentication (MFA), advanced data encryption, and continuous vulnerability monitoring.
